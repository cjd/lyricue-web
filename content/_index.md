**What is Lyricue?**  
Lyricue is free and open-source application that is used to edit/display song lyrics and passages of text along with images and videos on a second screen/projector. It was designed for use at live events such as church services, concerts and seminars.

**Why use lyricue?**  
With Lyricue you are not restricted to setting everything up before the event as you can add, remove and change songs on the fly.

You can edit a song while it is up on the screen and quickly show your changes (good for when you notice a misspelling or the singers decide to change the words on you)

You can even type up notes directly to the screen or quickly display a bible verse at an instants notice.

<div class="xi_postinpost">## [Lyricue Remote for Android 1.2 released](https://www.lyricue.org/2012/07/11/lyricue-remote-for-android-1-0-released/ "Readâ€¦")

<object class="xi_postinpost_content">I finally got around to writing an Android app to connect to Lyricue.  
I have uploaded it to the google store and it is available for download now!  
[  
![Get it on Google Play](https://www.android.com/images/brand/get_it_on_play_logo_large.png)  ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lyricue.android)

At this point most of the basic functionality is implemented such as quick controls, viewing playlists, adding/removing songs from playlists, adding bible verses (but with no page splitting as yet) and even quick access to putting text on the screen or OSD.  
Download it now and let me know how it goes ðŸ™‚
