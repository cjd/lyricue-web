**What is Lyricue?**  
Lyricue is free and open-source application that is used to edit/display song lyrics and passages of text along with images and videos on a second screen/projector. It was designed for use at live events such as church services, concerts and seminars.

**Why use lyricue?**  
With Lyricue you are not restricted to setting everything up before the event as you can add, remove and change songs on the fly.

You can edit a song while it is up on the screen and quickly show your changes (good for when you notice a misspelling or the singers decide to change the words on you)

You can even type up notes directly to the screen or quickly display a bible verse at an instants notice.

Updated packages for Ubuntu are available from the package archive at <https://code.launchpad.net/~chris-debenham/+archive/ubuntu/lyricue>

Source packages are now downloadable directly from github at <https://github.com/cjd/lyricue/releases>

At this point most of the basic functionality is implemented such as quick controls, viewing playlists, adding/removing songs from playlists, adding bible verses (but with no page splitting as yet) and even quick access to putting text on the screen or OSD.
