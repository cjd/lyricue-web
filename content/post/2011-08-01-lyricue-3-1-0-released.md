After much time I finally decided that lyricue 3.x is at the point I can call it 3.1 ðŸ™‚  
Since the release of 3.0 a lot of fixes and updates have gone in.  
The main things are:

- Works on Ubuntu oneiric, natty, maverick and lucid
- Handling of non-alpha characters in filenames has been fixed up
- You can associate font/shadow colours with a specific background (with a preview) via the media manager
- Dramatic speed increase in advanced search
- You can press enter to quickly add the first item found when searching the songlist
- Lyricue can directly play DVD titles
- Display live video feed as background
- Online documentation included in the application itself
- Video backgrounds play silently for a few seconds in the preview windows
- Smarter adding of image, video and music files to the playlist
- Imports pptx files (via workaround)
- Better handling of different multi-display setups
- Configuration now stored in the database directly
- Preview window added to edit/add song screen

Lyricue 3.1.0 has the following changes since 3.0.41

- Fix handling of apostrophe in presentation filenames
- Add text overlay in background manager so it is easier to check text colour
