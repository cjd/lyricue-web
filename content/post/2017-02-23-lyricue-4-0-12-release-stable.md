\* Set default songnumber when adding song (needed for newer mysql)  
\* make desktop files valid  
\* make NAME section of the manpage valid  
\* Don’t install INSTALL  
\* Use help: instead of ghelp  
\* Fix video playback when using clutter-gst &lt; 3  
\* Move tabs to be vertical and on the side
