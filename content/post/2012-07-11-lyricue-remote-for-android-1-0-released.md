I finally got around to writing an Android app to connect to Lyricue.  
I have uploaded it to the google store and it is available for download now!  
[  
![Get it on Google Play](https://www.android.com/images/brand/get_it_on_play_logo_large.png)  ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lyricue.android)

At this point most of the basic functionality is implemented such as quick controls, viewing playlists, adding/removing songs from playlists, adding bible verses (but with no page splitting as yet) and even quick access to putting text on the screen or OSD.  
Download it now and let me know how it goes ðŸ™‚
