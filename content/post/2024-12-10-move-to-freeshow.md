You may have noticed that there has not been an update to Lyricue for a number of years.  
Due to a number of reasons I haven't been able to maintain this application and so rather than lead people to think this project is still alive I thought it best to provide alternatives.  
If you are looking for a good, open-source presention application for your church I recommend looking at [FreeShow](https://freeshow.app)  
It is an excellent application which supports everything that Lyricue did and more.  It is supported on Linux, Windows and OSX  

This site will remain around, but unless someone else picks up maintenance of this application - it will remain as-is.
